# Technical Report: OpenFDA ETL Stabilization and Enhancements

## Overview
This report documents the recent work completed on the `medical_net` project to stabilize the OpenFDA ingestion pipeline and provide deterministic data loads compatible with existing database constraints.

## Key Issues Addressed
- **Empty API responses**: The scheduler previously aborted when OpenFDA returned a 404 `NOT_FOUND`. The adapter now recognizes this case and yields empty frames while logging a warning.
- **Inconsistent search parameters**: URL-encoded search strings in configuration were not decoded before being sent to OpenFDA, resulting in zero matches. Search terms are now normalized and can be defined via a structured `substances` list.
- **Database constraint violations**: Multiple API rows sharing the same substance generated duplicate `atc_code` values, conflicting with the unique constraint on `drugs.atc_code`. The pipeline now filters to one row per configured substance and propagates the chosen ATC code across normalized tables.

## Implementation Summary
1. **Configuration-driven targeting** (`config/sources.yaml`): Introduced a `substances` array for OpenFDA, replacing brittle encoded search strings and enabling clear operator control over the ingestion scope.
2. **Adapter resilience** (`pipelines/sources/openfda.py`):
   - Gracefully exits when OpenFDA reports `NOT_FOUND`.
   - Builds decoded search parameters and infers target substances from either configuration or search strings.
   - Filters raw payloads to a unique set of substances, avoiding duplicate database entries while preserving downstream condition mappings.
3. **Testing coverage** (`tests/test_openfda_adapter.py`): Added unit tests for empty responses, search-term construction, deduplication, and non-target filtering to lock in the new behaviour.

## Validation
- `cd etl && pytest tests/test_openfda_adapter.py`
- Manual scheduler run: `cd etl && python -m pipelines.scheduler` (requires network/database access) to confirm real OpenFDA data loads without integrity violations.

## Operational Guidance
- Update the `substances` list before each ingestion cycle to match the current research focus.
- Monitor scheduler logs for the `Source openfda returned no data` warning, which indicates that a query completed successfully but produced no matches.
- Re-run the adapter tests after any modification to the OpenFDA configuration or schema assumptions.

## Future Considerations
- Implement incremental pagination for larger substance sets once database storage requirements are confirmed.
- Add database-level UPSERT logic to `DatabaseWriter` for idempotent reprocessing of historical data.
- Expand integration testing to cover interactions between OpenFDA data and downstream analytics in the backend service.
